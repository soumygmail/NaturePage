        <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe.
             "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, 
             and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, 
             if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature,
              human activity is often understood as a separate category from other 
              natural phenomena.[1]
            The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived
             from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition",
              and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[2] In ancient philosophy, 
              natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις),
               which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, 
               and other features of the world to develop of their own accord.[3][4] 
               The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several 
               expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications 
               of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic 
               dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.

        <p>The primary focus of Naturalist Trips is learning about the natural world. 
            Topics may include identifying flora, fungi, or fauna, discussing geology,
             learning about edible plants or social uses of plants, exploring ecological
              or geologic processes, or pursuing the ecology of various plants and animals.
               This activity is all about helping participants connect deeper with nature,
                seeing details that might otherwise be missed. It is about showing participants
                 things in the natural world that might make their experience in the wilds 
                 richer and deeper.

                             My name is Davis Beckett, I am 11 years old and have always enjoyed spending time outside.
                               From going on hikes with my family, to climbing the tree in our backyard or even swimming
                                at the beach where my Grampa and Nana live. I just like being outside whenever and
                                 wherever I can!  The one thing I enjoy the most about nature though is being
                                  surrounded by the forest.  There is just something about how the forest surrounds
                                   me that makes me feel at home, it’s a peaceful and calm place that makes me happy. 
                                    I like to close my eyes and take it all in.  You can smell the moss on the trees,
                                     hear the sounds of a stream running close by and you can feel the forest floor
                                      beneath your feet.  It’s comforting like a cozy blanket on a cold day.</p>
